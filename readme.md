## FairLibJs

It is a library to annotate Javascript libraries according to FAIR metadata standards. It also has functions to derive edam ontology topics and operations from a text summary, either using standard NLP strategy or chatgpt (given your personal key). It also produces the jsonLD renderization from the docstrings used to annotate the javascript code and modules.
